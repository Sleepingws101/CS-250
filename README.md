•	How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

The best way to interpret the user’s needs is to leave as little as possible up to interpretation. This is done by asking questions during the information gathering process.
Asking as many specifics as possible, while also pitching your own ideas and getting feedback prior to development. User Stories help by allowing us to capture and summarize these needs so that they can stay fresh even during a long development process.

•	How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

For me, the best approach for developing programs is to gather as much information as possible and the brainstorming or planning how to go about meeting the specific needs of the stakeholders. If issues arise, it’s best to try to work it out on your own.
However, if it’s something that you need further assistance or clarification on, never be afraid to ask for help since that’s a core element of what Agile is. Some Agile processes I will likely incorporate in future works would include open communication, scaling workload, and accessing the needed features, their priority, and the size of each task.

•	What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

A good team member can come in all shapes and sizes and usually depends on what the needs of the team are. That said, being adaptable and well-rounded is an essential skill for any team member who wants to go above and beyond. 
By being knowledgeable, you can not only perform your own assigned tasks but also assist other team members who may be struggling. Additionally, it’s important to maintain open communication and to stay self-organized.
